2,British diver who rescued Thai boys from cave finds love with nurse | Daily Mail Online,1,http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5946671/Hero-British-diver-rescued-12-Thai-boys-trapped-cave-finds-love-local-nurse.html?ito=social-facebook&h=AT0ajXkfgykjvCKvjKPwCh2rPhbh77No8j6yDNAgbCmHTEcr5gGSz4-6CnJKcHOcJAYLHhXn_rLmoAG_4Ns9jadNV2QvufkAosrDNXs2ckzTc0d5-C6DHTs2QpleDUCn6UBL0ZW1EZMnm8tmbg,"

The hero British diver who rescued 12 Thai boys and their football coach from a flooded cave is dating a local nurse, MailOnline can reveal. 
Rick Stanton was the first person to reach the missing boys stranded in the flooded Tham Luang cave - and led the 'mission impossible' to free them. 

He has been dating Siripon Bugnngern, known as Amp, after meeting her just a few months ago while she was on holiday in England.
Amp is from Chiang Rai, northern Thailand, close to where the Wild Boar football team went missing on their ill-fated trip into the caves. 
She volunteered to work as a translator for the British diver and the rest of the rescue team when he was called in to find and rescue the stranded boys.
Hero British diver Rick Stanton who rescued 12 Thai boys and their football coach from a flooded cave is dating local nurse Siripon Bugnngern, known to her friends as Amp (pictured)
Mr Stanton, 57, who led the 'mission impossible' to free the boys met his girlfriend Amp while she was on holiday in England where the diver lives in Coventry and works as a firefighter
'Although it's early days and they haven't been together for long, Rick is absolutely besotted with Amp,' said a source.
'She is from Chiang Rai so when Rick was asked to come and help rescue the missing boys Amp was right by his side.
'She has been helping Rick and the other divers throughout the rescue operation. Amp is part of the team, helping translate between the British and Thai rescuers.
'They are very close. I wouldn't be surprised if they get married.'
Despite an age gap of more than 20 years, Rick and Amp share a passion for out-door pursuits. The couple are believed to have met several months ago.
Mr Stanton led the rescue attempt that captivated the world along with second British diver, John Volanthen. 
Mr Volanthen, 47, from Bristol, was part of the team that dived a recordbreaking 5.5 miles into the unexplored Pozo Azul cave system in Spain in 2010. 
Mr Stanton, who was awarded an MBE, has a reputation of being 'the man to call' for certain cave rescues. 
The firefighter from Coventry helped to rescue 13 British cavers in Mexico in 2004. 
The heroic diver Rick looked extremely happy next to his girlfriend Amp as they dined at Coventry Cathedral last month. Amp has been working as a translator during the dive rescue
Mr Stanton's girlfriend Amp is from Chiang Rai, not far from the cave where the boys were trapped for almost two weeks. She is pictured in the cave alongside her beau in the cave
The boys aged 11 to 16 from the Wild Boars football team had gone one an expedition of the cave's tunnels after training - but got lost sparking a rescue attempt that had gripped the world
He is a fanatical potholer and cave diver, while his new girlfriend loves canoeing and rock climbing and travelling.
The British diver had been on holiday to the Chiang Rai area seeing Amp just weeks before the disaster in which the dozen young players went missing in the flooded cave.
Dramatic footage of the rescue attempt showed Mr Stanton discovered the boys stuck on a ledge in the cave where they had been trapped without food or daylight for nine days.
On the video, Mr Stanton could be heard saying, 'How many of you? 13? Brilliant.' 
When asked by the group if they will be leaving the cave, the diver said: 'No, not today, not today. There's two of us. You'll have to dive.'  
However, Rick and Amp did not meet in Thailand, they met while she was on holiday in the UK from Australia, where she has been working as a nurse in a care home.
A friend revealed: 'Amp's home town is Chiang Rai, but she met Rick while she was on holiday from her nursing job in Australia.
Amp, a nurse, who was living in Australia when she met Mr Stanton worked as a translator between the British dive rescuers and their Thai counterparts
Mr Stanton (left) and his British dive colleague John Volanthen (right) were the first to reach the 12 boys and their coach inside the Luang Nang Non Cave, with assistance from fellow diver Rob Harper (centre) who flew out June 26 at the request of Thai authorities
Dramatic footage of the rescue showed Mr Stanton (left with Mr Volanthen, right) of the boys stuck on a ledge in the cave where they had been trapped without food or daylight for nine days. On the video, Mr Stanton could be heard saying, 'How many of you? 13? Brilliant.'
Following the rescue members of the 'Wild Boars' football team were pictured for the first time being treated at a hospital in Chiang Rai
'She came back to Chiang Rai just a few days before Rick was called to help in the rescue operation by chance.
'She took part in the rescue mission and stayed with the team of divers during the operation.'
Amp's skill and bravery in taking part in the rescue mission has also been praised.
Commenting on the picture of her with the rescue team inside the cave posted on Facebook, her friend Chadaporn Chamyam said: 'Permission to admire. Amp never told anyone where she was. She is such a good person and a role model.'
Mr Stanton previously lost out in love because of his obsession with caving.
His former partner of 25 years Angie Timms told how the young couple were initially hooked on the 'thrill' of caving.
But the pair grew apart and split up as he became more obsessed with going underground.
Angie, from Coventry, told MailOnline: 'Our paths and interests changed. He was into cave diving and doing it more and more and his lifestyle was getting too dangerous and I was worried about him.'

A banker strangled his girlfriend before dismembering her body in the bath and gouging out her internal organs, which he flushed down the toilet.

No remains of Nurbaeva have ever been found but the banker was convicted of murder this week after confessing to the gruesome crime — and 'repenting'.
23-year-old Vera Nurbaeva was violently murdered and dismembered by her boyfriend near Moscow, Russia
Bank of Moscow executive Sergey Kovalchuk was convicted of the murder after confessing to the crime, despite no body ever being found
A court heard how the victim Vera Nurbaeva was cut up using a kitchen knife before her body parts were placed in bin bags and dumped in a pond
The Bank of Moscow executive was sentenced to nine and a half years in jail for killing and dismembering the mother of one, who worked as a fitness club instructor and nightclub dancer.
The sentence was described as 'lenient' because he had confessed and cooperated with police.
A video of a reconstruction of the murder shows handcuffed Kovalchuk demonstrating to detectives how he dismembered his girlfriend's corpse.
Earlier there were reports that Nurbaeva had been abducted into forced prostitution by an international mafia ring.
Detective Dmitry Pichugin said the woman from Russian Buddhist region Buryatia had met Kovalchuk on the internet.
Earlier reports indicated Vera Nurbaeva, seen here with her mother Marina, had been abducted into forced prostitution by an international mafia ring
Detectives said Sergey Kovalchuk strangled his girlfriend after being accused of stealing her mobile phone
They spent New Year together but then had a row after she accused him of stealing her mobile phone, and he strangled her in his Moscow apartment, he said.
'Sergey grabbed Vera by the neck, and lying on the sofa on top of the victim, he strangled her with both hands,' the court was told.
'After the murder, he went to the supermarket nearby and bought cigarettes....
'He put the body to the bath and turned on the cold water shower directing it over her body.'
He slept and when he awoke he 'decided to dismember her', according to criminal investigators in their macabre case report submitted to court.
The nightclub dancer met Sergey Kovalchuk through the internet. The pair spent  New Year together before a row broke out at his apartment
It was revealed Vera was 'grabbed by the neck' before being strangled on the sofa
Sergey will serve a 'lenient' nine-and-a-half year sentence as he cooperated with police
'He started with the arms cutting them each into three pieces, and the legs into two, cut off the tendons and severed the hip joint.
'Then he tried to cut her backbone, but could not. He bent her body so that it broke.
'Next he cut and gouged out her abdomen, took away the intestines and entrails and threw them into the toilet.

He put other remains in four plastic bags and rented a car to dump them at a pond in the Moscow suburb of Khimki.

8,Villagers evacuated over fears huge 100m high chunk could break off iceberg and cause  tsunami | Daily Mail Online,1,http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5951561/Villagers-evacuated-fears-huge-100m-high-chunk-break-iceberg-cause-tsunami.html?ito=social-facebook&h=AT1IrTQ4QoYtz5uUqRGHy1cvZbjWkIl4yZX02xs7aUtaUwFYqEC77FZTE7ze4MpAd-POeZqz56GSxi49Ine_GnwEuLEE2KqCvMFqAt2WCRgZ-8O_It6O4NVGY8lyjbjMSQ8rVSdqkTrCJQaUDA,"

Villagers have been evacuated over concerns that an iceberg the size of a hill drifting off Greenland is about to shed a 100-metre chunk and cause a 'tsunami'.
Fearing that the iceberg will trigger flooding, authorities have moved residents from the danger zone of the remote Innaarsuit island settlement.
Households on a promontory have been told to move away from the shore over concerns that the 100-metre (over 300 feet) high iceberg, which was spotted on Thursday, could swamp the area.
Too close for comfort, the iceberg, which towers over the village of Innarsuit, northwestern Greenland, could suddenly lose a chunk of ice and cause a flood of water 
'We fear the iceberg could calve [suddenly release a chunk of ice] and send a flood towards the village,' Lina Davidsen, a security chief at the Greenland police, told Danish news agency Ritzau today.
While the settlement in northwestern Greenland has about 170 inhabitants, only those living closest to the iceberg have been evacuated further up a steep slope.
The iceberg towers over houses on a promontory in the village, but it is grounded on the sea floor and has not moved overnight, state broadcaster KNR reported.
'The iceberg is still near the village and the police are now discussing what do to next,' Kunuk Frediksen, a police chief in the Danish autonomous territory, told AFP.
While it was not unusual for large icebergs to be seen so close to Innaarsuit, 'this iceberg is the biggest we have seen... and there are cracks and holes that make us fear it can calve anytime,' said Susanne K. Eliassen, a member of the village council.
The village's power station and fuel tanks are close to the shore.
'Nobody is staying unnecessarily close to the beach and all children have been told to stay in areas that are high up,' Eliassen told the local newspaper Sermitsiaq.
The government and police are on high alert and have moved a search-and-rescue (SAR) helicopter closer to the remote village.
The incident comes weeks after scientists at New York University shot and released a video of a massive iceberg breaking free from a glacier in eastern Greenland in June.
An expert warned that extreme iceberg events will become more frequent.
'Iceberg production in Greenland has been increasing in the past 100 years as climate change has become stronger,' William Colgan, senior researcher at the Geological Survey of Denmark and Greenland, told AFP.
He said the rising number of icebergs are in turn 'increasing the tsunami hazards' which occur when they break away from a glacier and trigger a tidal wave.
Last summer, four people died and 11 were injured after an earthquake sparked a tsunami off another island settlement called Nuugaatsiaq, northwestern Greenland, sending several houses crashing into the sea.

It can be a challenge to watch most Marvel movies stoned—too many characters and subplots to keep in my head—but Doctor Strange is brain food mixed with a healthy dose of eye-candy. The “Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds” special effects, time-bending plot devices, and vital appreciation of Beyonce provide more than enough for the mind to chew on. Plus it’s just weird thinking about British actors doing American accents.

Baseball collectibles like cards and bobbleheads are being revamped for the 21st century — on the blockchain. Major League Baseball has announced that it is launching a crypto-based game that runs on the ethereum blockchain later this summer.


Developers aren’t only targeting people who are already involved in the crypto scene either. They’re looking to build a game that is easy to understand and use for the masses of people who don’t know what the blockchain or ethereum are. Still, developers say there will be a learning curve, and the game will roll out in stages to help new players get accustomed to the concept.

42,East Texas man finds snake in his fireplace - BIGCOUNTRYHOMEPAGE,1,https://www.bigcountryhomepage.com/news/main-news/east-texas-man-finds-snake-in-his-fireplace/1295892256?utm_medium=social&utm_source=facebook_KRBC_News&h=AT0o6yskj2W2Ql07VeuLml3dsFQ7iGvVzOKKMtWZisdxGlIykyKW9ZfLSzSlFFrg_Gfecg_dgbL4lcUB-SkHBiUeNRk4dLhCfkw0eNvIuh5q5G6Qb0jDfOr_LziUBoU481Bb4Orluvp_8pJTxA,"



But for one East Texas man, that's exactly what he found.
""There's never a dull moment around our place, and I think this proves it,"" said Gary David Antley, who found a snake in his fireplace.
Just after 2:30 a.m. July 7, Antley was finishing up some paperwork when he heard a loud ""clunk"" and he went to investigate.
""And I go from mild mannered, just passing through, I pass up the panic stage and I go clean to, 'Oh God, what do I do!?'"" said Antley.

To his surprise, a large Texas rat snake dropped down his chimney for a visit.
Antley grabbed some barbecue tongs, and his daughter set up the camera.
""I just gritted my teeth and I went for it, went in there and grabbed him by the neck,"" said Antley. ""Well nothing too bad happened and then he got tangled up in the fire curtain.""
Thankfully Texas rat snakes, or chicken snakes, are non-venomous and harmless to people.
Antley immediately recognized what kind of snake he was dealing with.
""I (knew) I wouldn't die from snake venom, I would die from a heart attack,"" he said.
The video, which as of July 10 has around 25,000 views, has even caught the attention of some snake experts.
""I'm always interested in people's reactions to snakes,"" said Gordon Henley, Ellen Trout Zoo director. ""And having a snake in the fireplace in the house is an unusual occurrence.""
But how exactly could a snake get in your fireplace?
""A tree near the house with a branch over the house,"" said Henley. ""The snake can just, literally, go right up the bark of that tree and get out on a branch and get into the chimney from the top.""
Though the experience brought Antley from a baritone to a soprano, he is glad people have seen it.
""They can use it for entertainment, but I definitely wouldn't use it for a training video on how to remove a snake because there's got to be a better way,"" he said.
After it was over, he turned the snake loose a few miles down the road, where it can eat mice and hopefully not bother anyone else.
