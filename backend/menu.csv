1,Trump breaks protocol during Royal visit twice after failing to bow and walking in front of Queen | Daily Mail Online,1,http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5952671/Trump-breaks-protocol-Royal-visit-twice-failing-bow-walking-Queen.html?ito=social-facebook&h=AT091-lRxwI7ZPRrCwejqJ9jxJna4csRruH0Wbbf8zs1EGlTBKqDYvEmphb-fZ2EKOhAqSgRmuVMYU2iiqi55ZYmRFXyi61tYvJ5YyFkYH0sVyAZWx1p-dPRzG1krsG0gt-D2Ru9Z0Nob0XCnQ,"

He is used to being out of step with other leaders, and perhaps he was caught up in the excitement of the occasion.
Donald Trump kept the Queen waiting for more than 10 minutes for the arrival of the black Range Rover used to transport him and his wife Melania to Windsor Castle.
And at one point Mr Trump appeared to breach royal protocol, marching in front of the Queen while they inspected the guard of honour.
The President looked out of step with the official choreography – causing the Queen to point tentatively and ask him to move to the left.
However, Mr Trump failed to pick up on the signal and instead came to an abrupt stop in front of her.
The Queen abandoned her efforts to get the President to move and simply shuffled around him. 
Mr Trump continued to stand stock-still, staring at the Coldstream Guards – who were in their traditional bearskin hats despite the 27C (81F) heat.
This way: They inspect the Coldstream Guards at Windsor Castle
Do get out of one's way, Donald! The president blocks the Queen at Windsor Castle
So she carries on without him, as he appears to be transfixed by the spectacle
Striding out in front of the Queen
Perhaps in deference to the Army’s second most senior regiment, Mr Trump appeared to be transfixed by their resplendent appearance and was rooted to the spot for several moments.
The Queen, who is used to inspecting her guards, appeared to leave him behind before she spurred him into movement again with a swift hand gesture.
His gaffes were slammed on social media, with Joanna Gasiorowska, Al Jazeera senior sports presenter tweeting, ‘I can’t even watch this… No bow or curtsey [sic] and now #Trump walks in front of the Queen… surely he knows the protocol but chooses to ignore it and that’s just b***** rude.'
Back in step: The Queen with US President Donald Trump

The problem with this entire situation should be immediately apparent. The practice of casting cisgender actors as trans people perpetuates the idea that trans people, somehow, are pretending to be something they aren’t; that being trans is inherently an act or performance.

Often the argument against assigning actual trans people these roles is that the job should simply go to “the actor best suited for it”—that the pool of trans A-listers is either marginal or nonexistent. This implies there aren’t any readily available trans actors who can do the job just as well as anyone else. Casting has to start somewhere, and at some point, the gatekeeper has to open the gates. If trans actors continue to be denied roles and opportunity, it becomes impossible for their profiles to grow in the entertainment industry. 
It seems a far stretch of the imagination to think a cisgender actor can, in any meaningful way, understand the complexities and nuances of a trans person’s humanity. The distance between the two experiences just isn’t one that can be closed by hair and makeup.

Ted Bundy admitted to 30 murders and may have killed as many as 100 women
The lawyer who defended serial killer Ted Bundy has spoken out, saying he believes the murderer was 'born evil' and intentionally sought the death penalty.
None
Though Bundy admitted to committing 30 murders across several states in the 1970s, authorities fear he may have had a hand in as many as 100 slayings. Bundy was executed by the state of Florida in 1989 at age 42.
The infamous killer was best known for his ruse of charming young women while pretending to need crutches or a cast, and then killing them at other locations which he'd repeatedly revisit to groom or abuse the bodies in sick postmortem rituals. 
Browne first became involved in Bundy's defense when the killer was living in Seattle free on bail, pending his trial in a kidnapping case in Utah.

Attorney John Henry Browne, 71, (above) opened up about his chilling experience with the notorious killer for a new episode of the documentary series 'In Defense Of'
Bundy was best known for his ruse of charming young women while pretending to need crutches or a cast, then abducting and killing them before revisiting the bodies repeatedly
'Ted knew he was being followed - there was no subtlety to what the task force was doing while he was in Seattle,' Browne recalled in a preview for the new episode.
'Ted actually enjoyed the attention he was getting from the media and police. They were following him everywhere, and that became almost comical, because Ted would make fun of them - he'd make cookies for the cops. He'd knock on their windows, like make coffee and take it to the surveillance vehicles,' said Browne.
'When I first met Ted, my strategy was to minimize the public's belief that he was 'the Ted,'' said Browne. 
But over the course of a decade representing Bundy, the defense attorney eventually came to find that he was the worst of the worst.
None
'This is really the only person, after representing thousands of clients in 40 years that I would say that about,' he continued. 'I didn't want to believe people were born evil, but I came to the conclusion that Ted was… He had this energy about him that was clearly deceptive, very sociopathic.'
Bundy was convicted of kidnapping in Utah in 1976, by which time the handsome psychopath had come under suspicion for dozens of murders spanning multiple states.
One year into his sentence in Utah, he was extradited to Colorado to face charges in the murder of 23-year-old nurse Caryn Campbell.

Bundy, acting as his own attorney in the Campbell case, failed in one escape attempt in Aspen, Colorado. Browne believes he had a 'death wish' and wanted to get to a state that had the death penalty.
'He asked me in Colorado where a person would actually go to get the death penalty and I said, immediately, Florida or Texas,' said Browne. 'And then he escapes a second time and goes to Florida.'
Bundy effected a daring, meticulously planned jailbreak on New Year's Eve 1977, taking advantage of the holiday to shimmy through the ceiling to the warden's office, don the warden's street clothes and walk out the front door of the jail.
Just weeks later, Bundy went on a violent sexual rampage though a Florida State University sorority, killing two young women and seriously injuring two others.
Soon after, the sociopath abducted and murdered 12-year-old Kimberly Diane Leach.
On February 8, 1978, just five weeks after his jailbreak in Colorado, Bundy's final murder spree came to an end with his arrest, when he was pulled over in a stolen car.

Bundy watches intently during the third day of jury selection at his trial in Orlando for the murder of 12-year-old Kimberly Leach. He was convicted and sentenced to execution
Reports at the time indicated that Bundy was offered a pre-trial plea bargain, in which he would plea guilty to the murder of Leach and the two sorority sisters, in exchange for 75 years in prison. 
'Nobody would ever believe you could get a plea bargain for Ted Bundy, but I did with one other lawyer,' recalls Browne. 
Bundy is seen during his trial in Florida. His lawyer says he wanted to be executed
'He turns around and says, 'I'm not going to do it.' That's when we told him we weren't going to help him anymore. We felt he had a death wish. So yes, I think it could be reasonably concluded that Ted had a death wish,' the lawyer said.
Browne described Bundy's personality as a series of masks, cunningly designed to charm, manipulate and deceive.
There was just one moment before the trial in Florida, the attorney said, when the masks slipped, and he felt he got a glimpse at another side of Bundy as he sat in his jail cell. 
'He said to me, ""John, I want to be a good person, but I'm just not,"" said Browne. 'He actually fell to the floor cell and had tears in his eyes when he said that… It was the first time I ever saw him truly emotional.'
'He was acknowledging that he was basically an evil person who has done awful things and he wished he wasn't that anymore… He snapped out of that after three hours and went back to the facade of Ted.'
Bundy was convicted and sentenced to execution. On death row, he admitted to  30 murders, but said there were others so heinous that he would never confess.
The full episode of 'In Defense Of' airs on Sunday, July 15 at 8pm on Oxygen.

According to the Montgomery County, Texas District Attorney’s Office, Sarah Peters, 25, pleaded guilty to sexual performance of a child, attempted human trafficking and promotion of prostitution of a child.
Investigators said Peters contacted a person online and agreed to sell her child for sex. That person turned out to be an undercover officer.
Peters then brought her daughter to Conroe Texas on the agreed upon date in order to allow a man to engage in sex acts with the child for $1,200. She was intercepted at a Greyhound bus station in Montgomery, Texas.
She was sentenced to 40 years on the sexual performance of a child case and to 20 years on the other charges. She won’t be eligible for parole until 2038.
The District Attorney’s Office released the following statement:
""The events of this case are hard to believe - that a mom would willingly expose her own daughter to this type of danger. And without the proactive work of (the detectives) and the ICAC Task Force, this child would have become a victim to the worse type of abuse. Our citizens must realize this type of activity happens in our community. We need the community to be vigilant and report to law enforcement any activity they see/hear where a child might be in danger of abuse or sexual exportation. We are very fortunate to have this team of dedicated law enforcement professionals working so diligently for the safety of our children and community.""

Local and state officials will now be able to carry out “live code” tests of the Emergency Alert System. This would allow tests to be conducted with all the alert protocols and sounds of an actual alert, but fully planned, labeled as a test, and with prior notifications of the test for the general public.
The FCC also unveiled that public service announcements about the Emergency Alert System will now present itself as an actual emergency alert. With these new procedures, it looks like the Commission is making moves to normalize these alerts so tests can be carried out without the worry of an error leading to a widespread panic.
In their announcement, the FCC also outlines the processes that need to be taken and requires the Commission to be contacted, in the event that another false emergency alert is sent out.
These changes to the Emergency Alert System look like they could be helpful in preventing the next false “there is a missile about to hit your state” alarm. However, these FCC updates don’t really seem to prevent what actually caused the Hawaii panic in the first place: human error thanks to bad user interface.

The hero British diver who rescued 12 Thai boys and their football coach from a flooded cave is dating a local nurse, MailOnline can reveal. 
Rick Stanton was the first person to reach the missing boys stranded in the flooded Tham Luang cave - and led the 'mission impossible' to free them. 
None
He has been dating Siripon Bugnngern, known as Amp, after meeting her just a few months ago while she was on holiday in England.
Amp is from Chiang Rai, northern Thailand, close to where the Wild Boar football team went missing on their ill-fated trip into the caves. 
She volunteered to work as a translator for the British diver and the rest of the rescue team when he was called in to find and rescue the stranded boys.
Hero British diver Rick Stanton who rescued 12 Thai boys and their football coach from a flooded cave is dating local nurse Siripon Bugnngern, known to her friends as Amp (pictured)
Mr Stanton, 57, who led the 'mission impossible' to free the boys met his girlfriend Amp while she was on holiday in England where the diver lives in Coventry and works as a firefighter
'Although it's early days and they haven't been together for long, Rick is absolutely besotted with Amp,' said a source.
'She is from Chiang Rai so when Rick was asked to come and help rescue the missing boys Amp was right by his side.
'She has been helping Rick and the other divers throughout the rescue operation. Amp is part of the team, helping translate between the British and Thai rescuers.
'They are very close. I wouldn't be surprised if they get married.'
Despite an age gap of more than 20 years, Rick and Amp share a passion for out-door pursuits. The couple are believed to have met several months ago.
Mr Stanton led the rescue attempt that captivated the world along with second British diver, John Volanthen. 
Mr Volanthen, 47, from Bristol, was part of the team that dived a recordbreaking 5.5 miles into the unexplored Pozo Azul cave system in Spain in 2010. 
Mr Stanton, who was awarded an MBE, has a reputation of being 'the man to call' for certain cave rescues. 
The firefighter from Coventry helped to rescue 13 British cavers in Mexico in 2004. 
The heroic diver Rick looked extremely happy next to his girlfriend Amp as they dined at Coventry Cathedral last month. Amp has been working as a translator during the dive rescue
Mr Stanton's girlfriend Amp is from Chiang Rai, not far from the cave where the boys were trapped for almost two weeks. She is pictured in the cave alongside her beau in the cave
The boys aged 11 to 16 from the Wild Boars football team had gone one an expedition of the cave's tunnels after training - but got lost sparking a rescue attempt that had gripped the world
He is a fanatical potholer and cave diver, while his new girlfriend loves canoeing and rock climbing and travelling.
The British diver had been on holiday to the Chiang Rai area seeing Amp just weeks before the disaster in which the dozen young players went missing in the flooded cave.
Dramatic footage of the rescue attempt showed Mr Stanton discovered the boys stuck on a ledge in the cave where they had been trapped without food or daylight for nine days.
On the video, Mr Stanton could be heard saying, 'How many of you? 13? Brilliant.' 
When asked by the group if they will be leaving the cave, the diver said: 'No, not today, not today. There's two of us. You'll have to dive.'  
However, Rick and Amp did not meet in Thailand, they met while she was on holiday in the UK from Australia, where she has been working as a nurse in a care home.
A friend revealed: 'Amp's home town is Chiang Rai, but she met Rick while she was on holiday from her nursing job in Australia.
Amp, a nurse, who was living in Australia when she met Mr Stanton worked as a translator between the British dive rescuers and their Thai counterparts
Mr Stanton (left) and his British dive colleague John Volanthen (right) were the first to reach the 12 boys and their coach inside the Luang Nang Non Cave, with assistance from fellow diver Rob Harper (centre) who flew out June 26 at the request of Thai authorities
Dramatic footage of the rescue showed Mr Stanton (left with Mr Volanthen, right) of the boys stuck on a ledge in the cave where they had been trapped without food or daylight for nine days. On the video, Mr Stanton could be heard saying, 'How many of you? 13? Brilliant.'
Following the rescue members of the 'Wild Boars' football team were pictured for the first time being treated at a hospital in Chiang Rai
'She came back to Chiang Rai just a few days before Rick was called to help in the rescue operation by chance.
'She took part in the rescue mission and stayed with the team of divers during the operation.'
Amp's skill and bravery in taking part in the rescue mission has also been praised.
Commenting on the picture of her with the rescue team inside the cave posted on Facebook, her friend Chadaporn Chamyam said: 'Permission to admire. Amp never told anyone where she was. She is such a good person and a role model.'
Mr Stanton previously lost out in love because of his obsession with caving.
His former partner of 25 years Angie Timms told how the young couple were initially hooked on the 'thrill' of caving.
But the pair grew apart and split up as he became more obsessed with going underground.
Angie, from Coventry, told MailOnline: 'Our paths and interests changed. He was into cave diving and doing it more and more and his lifestyle was getting too dangerous and I was worried about him.'

Earlier there were reports that Nurbaeva had been abducted into forced prostitution by an international mafia ring.
Detective Dmitry Pichugin said the woman from Russian Buddhist region Buryatia had met Kovalchuk on the internet.

19,Villagers evacuated over fears huge 100m high chunk could break off iceberg and cause  tsunami | Daily Mail Online,1,http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5951561/Villagers-evacuated-fears-huge-100m-high-chunk-break-iceberg-cause-tsunami.html?ito=social-facebook&h=AT3e-C6lic2TgGlWDEIVDiRUgzNEWTJf06Dh6D2A9qdTlrozJ5_8gK6_6Awq2QvABK0-V5kNW8jE6E_bvrGxEIHr7j7I9H_krD_ZgJnaCcmC2rBwElr_kgwZD_xD1Rnl41MNQfFdDI-up_vIbg,"

Villagers have been evacuated over concerns that an iceberg the size of a hill drifting off Greenland is about to shed a 100-metre chunk and cause a 'tsunami'.
Fearing that the iceberg will trigger flooding, authorities have moved residents from the danger zone of the remote Innaarsuit island settlement.
Households on a promontory have been told to move away from the shore over concerns that the 100-metre (over 300 feet) high iceberg, which was spotted on Thursday, could swamp the area.
Too close for comfort, the iceberg, which towers over the village of Innarsuit, northwestern Greenland, could suddenly lose a chunk of ice and cause a flood of water 
'We fear the iceberg could calve [suddenly release a chunk of ice] and send a flood towards the village,' Lina Davidsen, a security chief at the Greenland police, told Danish news agency Ritzau today.
While the settlement in northwestern Greenland has about 170 inhabitants, only those living closest to the iceberg have been evacuated further up a steep slope.
The iceberg towers over houses on a promontory in the village, but it is grounded on the sea floor and has not moved overnight, state broadcaster KNR reported.
'The iceberg is still near the village and the police are now discussing what do to next,' Kunuk Frediksen, a police chief in the Danish autonomous territory, told AFP.
While it was not unusual for large icebergs to be seen so close to Innaarsuit, 'this iceberg is the biggest we have seen... and there are cracks and holes that make us fear it can calve anytime,' said Susanne K. Eliassen, a member of the village council.
The village's power station and fuel tanks are close to the shore.
'Nobody is staying unnecessarily close to the beach and all children have been told to stay in areas that are high up,' Eliassen told the local newspaper Sermitsiaq.
The government and police are on high alert and have moved a search-and-rescue (SAR) helicopter closer to the remote village.
The incident comes weeks after scientists at New York University shot and released a video of a massive iceberg breaking free from a glacier in eastern Greenland in June.
An expert warned that extreme iceberg events will become more frequent.
'Iceberg production in Greenland has been increasing in the past 100 years as climate change has become stronger,' William Colgan, senior researcher at the Geological Survey of Denmark and Greenland, told AFP.
He said the rising number of icebergs are in turn 'increasing the tsunami hazards' which occur when they break away from a glacier and trigger a tidal wave.
Last summer, four people died and 11 were injured after an earthquake sparked a tsunami off another island settlement called Nuugaatsiaq, northwestern Greenland, sending several houses crashing into the sea.

It can be a challenge to watch most Marvel movies stoned—too many characters and subplots to keep in my head—but Doctor Strange is brain food mixed with a healthy dose of eye-candy. The “Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds” special effects, time-bending plot devices, and vital appreciation of Beyonce provide more than enough for the mind to chew on. Plus it’s just weird thinking about British actors doing American accents.

Still, developers say there will be a learning curve, and the game will roll out in stages to help new players get accustomed to the concept.

This comment doesn’t exactly explain the rationale behind today’s acquisition, but Broadcom is clearly trying to diversify its offerings. Earlier this year, the company walked away from its proposed hostile takeover of Qualcomm after the Trump administration blocked it. At the time, Broadcom was willing to pay $117 billion for Qualcomm, which would have greatly extended the company’s semiconductor business. Today’s move sees Broadcom enter a completely new business.
The company expects the acquisition to close in the fourth quarter of 2018. It’s unlikely that Broadcom will face any major headwind from Washington this time around.",https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/GettyImages-969249096.jpg?w=606,12/07/2018 07:04,TechCrunch

A child under the age of 15 was also in the back seat.
Bowman was indicted for Possession of Meth with Intent to Deliver, Possession of Meth, and Abandoning/Endangering a Child.

But for one East Texas man, that's exactly what he found.
""There's never a dull moment around our place, and I think this proves it,"" said Gary David Antley, who found a snake in his fireplace.
Just after 2:30 a.m. July 7, Antley was finishing up some paperwork when he heard a loud ""clunk"" and he went to investigate.
""And I go from mild mannered, just passing through, I pass up the panic stage and I go clean to, 'Oh God, what do I do!?'"" said Antley.
None
To his surprise, a large Texas rat snake dropped down his chimney for a visit.
Antley grabbed some barbecue tongs, and his daughter set up the camera.
""I just gritted my teeth and I went for it, went in there and grabbed him by the neck,"" said Antley. ""Well nothing too bad happened and then he got tangled up in the fire curtain.""
Thankfully Texas rat snakes, or chicken snakes, are non-venomous and harmless to people.
Antley immediately recognized what kind of snake he was dealing with.
""I (knew) I wouldn't die from snake venom, I would die from a heart attack,"" he said.
The video, which as of July 10 has around 25,000 views, has even caught the attention of some snake experts.
""I'm always interested in people's reactions to snakes,"" said Gordon Henley, Ellen Trout Zoo director. ""And having a snake in the fireplace in the house is an unusual occurrence.""
But how exactly could a snake get in your fireplace?
""A tree near the house with a branch over the house,"" said Henley. ""The snake can just, literally, go right up the bark of that tree and get out on a branch and get into the chimney from the top.""
Though the experience brought Antley from a baritone to a soprano, he is glad people have seen it.
""They can use it for entertainment, but I definitely wouldn't use it for a training video on how to remove a snake because there's got to be a better way,"" he said.
After it was over, he turned the snake loose a few miles down the road, where it can eat mice and hopefully not bother anyone else.

Lines at the mall in Tyler, Texas, stretch from one end of the mall to the other. It is estimated more than 1,000 people showed up for the promotion.
At the Tyler location, customers began lining up as early as 5 a.m. The mall opens at 9 a.m.
According to a mall spokesperson, the Tyler store will be selling 700 bears today and giving $15 vouchers to anyone else who did not get a bear.
Lines have been cut off for the day.
Build-A-Bear issued an alert on their website.
Please be aware: Based on the unprecedented response to our Pay Your Age Day event in our early opening stores, we are experiencing significantly longer than expected lines and large crowds. Local authorities are requiring us to limit the lines and crowds due to safety concerns. We understand this is disappointing, we are working to address the situation, and we will be reaching out to our valued Guests soon.

After four years, the truth is finally emerging as to how unrest and violence was engineered in Kiev – and with much of the evidence hiding in plain sight…
None

“..18th-19th February, 2014 the attacks on police units in Lvov started: the Galitsky, Zaliznychny, Lychakovsky, and Frankovsky district police departments in Lvov; the Lvov city police department, the department of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Ukraine in the Lvov region; on the premises of the ‘Grifon’ and ‘Berkut’ special forces. During the attack on the premises of police units, a total of 1,223 firearms and 68,921 pieces of ammunition were stolen.
Similar attacks were committed against police officers in the Rovno, Volyn, and Ternopol regions.
So far these crimes have not been solved, and the stolen weapons have not been seized.
According to the Commission, these weapons with a high share of probability were used by unknown persons who opened fire from Maidan at employees of the ‘Berkut’ special forces and the internal troops (materials on this question were sent to the Prosecutor General’s Office of Ukraine on June 11th, 2014).
…According to the emergency medical service of Kiev, from 6-10 a.m. unknown persons began shooting from Maidan square and the surrounding streets at the police and internal troops.
Thus, from 18th to 20th February, 2014, 196 police officers and internal troops received gunshot wounds, and 7 servicemen of the internal troops and 10 employees of internal affairs bodies were killed. It should be noted that at the time of receiving gunshot wounds police officers and the military personnel of the internal troops were without their service weapons.
Those with gunshot wounds among military personnel and police officers were sent to the central hospital of the Ministry of Defence, the central hospital of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Ukraine, and the hospital of the main department of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Ukraine in Kiev where surgical help was provided.
For unknown reasons, operational-investigation groups did not come to investigate these facts, that’s why the bullets that had been extracted from the bodies of the wounded remained in hospitals. During operations, the extracted bullets were placed in one container, making it impossible to identify what specific weapon wounded what specific employee of the police or interior troops.
Neither the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Ukraine, nor the Prosecutor General’s Office of Ukraine have yet established who exactly opened fire at law enforcement officers.
Under strange circumstances, all materials on the facts of receiving gunshot wounds and the murdering of police officers were transferred by the Prosecutor General’s Office of Ukraine to pre-trial investigation in the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Ukraine.
In fact, the investigation is not being carried out – the leadership of the Ministry of Internal Affairs tries to get out of it.
The Commission established that the political parties ‘Fatherland’, ‘Udar’, and ‘Svoboda’ didn’t have armed formations on Euromaidan. Moreover, with the help of their activists and people’s deputies they identified individuals with firearms and handed them over to employees of the Interior Ministry of Kiev. Everyone who was on Euromaidan during the mass standoff were categorically forbidden from possessing firearms.
Taking into account that the Commission is not a subject of operational-investigative activities, it has no way of identify the persons who used firearms.
The Commission considers that these persons may have been:
1. Agents of the Interior Ministry and SBU who were pretending to be Euromaidan activists (they could’ve been given weapons that had even seized from illegal circulation and stored in the warehouses of the Interior Ministry and SBU);
2. Staff members of the operational services of the Interior Ministry and the SBU who posed as activists of Euromaidan and hid their faces behind masks;
None
It is established that many gunshot wounds were inflicted by snipers – this was done to escalate the socio-political tension in Kiev in order to have the opportunity in the future to introduce martial law (materials on this fact were sent to the Prosecutor General’s Office of Ukraine on May 21st, 2014)…”

Crowd sourcing: The Fat Jew has created a GoFundMe page to raise $100 million for makeup mogul Kylie Jenner to make her a billionaire
'I don’t want to live in a world where Kylie Jenner doesn’t have a billion dollars. WE MUST RAISE 100 MILLION DOLLARS TO HELP HER GET TO A BILLION, PLEASE SPREAD THE WORD, THIS IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT,' the mission statement concluded.
The fundraiser in a day had raised $68 of its $100 million goal.
The Fat Jew, real name Josh Ostrovsky, shared the GoFundMe campaign on with his roughly 10.5 million followers on Instagram.
Kylie graced the August 31, 2018 isue of Forbes titled America's Women Billionaires ranking the 60 richest self-made women. 
Online star: Josh Ostrovsky, aka The Fat Jew, is shown in April in New York City
Forbes reported that Kylie, who will turn 21 in August, launched her Kylie Cosmetics two years ago and has sold more than $630 million worth of makeup since.
The magazine valued her company at nearly $800 million and with her reality shows and product endorsements pegged her net worth conservatively at $900 million.
Forbes estimated that Kylie has surpassed her older sister Kim Kardashian West, 37, who has a net worth of $350 million. 
Cosmetics queen: Kylie,20, graced the cover of Forbes who valued her net worth at $900 million and said she was on the way to becoming the youngest 'self-made' billionaire ever
Kylie's inclusion in the list of the 'self-made' wealthy was challenged on social media with critics noting that she came from a life of privilege.
The GoFundMe page was liked by Kylie and Pagesix reported that if the fundraising challenge isn't met that donations will go to those in need.
'All money will be donated to something awesome, like a charity that feeds people who don’t have food,' Ostrovsky said.
Self made? Social media was quick to criticize Forbes for categorizing Kylie as a 'self-made' billionaire

73,McDonald’s Canada to start buying ‘sustainable’ beef - The Globe and Mail,1,https://www.theglobeandmail.com/business/article-mcdonalds-canada-to-start-buying-sustainable-beef/,"
The subject who is truly loyal to the Chief Magistrate will neither advise nor submit to arbitrary measures.
McDonald’s Canada says it will be the first Canadian company to acquire beef that is “certified sustainable” according to standards outlined by the Canadian Roundtable for Sustainable Beef (CRSB).
The chain says more than 20 million of its Angus burgers will be sourced according to the CRSB standards over the next 12 months.
Those standards include ensuring animals have adequate feed and access to drinking water and that they endure minimal stress and pain.
Story continues below advertisement
Farmer and ranchers must also manage grasslands and grazing in a way that maintains or improves soil health and protects watersheds.
McDonald’s Canada says it gets 100 per cent of the beef for its hamburgers from Canadian ranches and farms, primarily in Alberta and Saskatchewan.
This move comes about a month after the chain began selling bagels at all of its Canadian locations to woo breakfast diners.
“Consumers are increasingly inquisitive about the food they’re eating and want to know it was produced in a socially responsible, economically viable and environmentally sound manner,” said Cherie Copithorne-Barnes, a rancher and chairwoman of the CRSB.
“As we all strive to make continuous improvements, it’s important to recognize achievements made along the way.”

No dice: Rapper Tekashi 6ix9ine unsuccessfully requested bail in an NYC courtroom on Thursday, and will be remit into custody until officials extradite him to Texas next month

'I was not very responsible knowing it was that serious of a warrant for a misdemeanor.'

A 16-year-old Ethiopian runner has been cruelly ridiculed online by social media users – including a Spanish athlete – who say she looks too old to be competing in an under-20 competition.
None
But Gebrzihair's third place finish led to a backlash on social media from commenters who questioned her listed birth date of November 21, 2001.
However, none of the critics have provided any evidence to prove the provided birth date is false. 
Girmawit Gebrzihair (pictured), a 16-year-old Ethiopian runner, has been ridiculed online by social media users who say she looks too old to be competing in an under-20 competition
Gebrzihair (circled) won the bronze medal in the 5,000m race at the World Under-20 Championships
Among those who mocked the athlete online was Oscar Husillos, a Spanish sprinter who specialises in the 200m and 400m.
The 24-year-old retweeted a picture of Gebrzihair, adding in Spanish: 'Her children and grandchildren are in the stands to see her run in the World U20 Championships.'
However, his tweet also sparked a backlash - with some slamming the athlete for his lack of respect and defended Gebrzihair.
'This comment is disrespectful. The IAAF should sanction you,' one person responded.
'You may have doubts about their age, but you could express them with more education,' another Twitter user said.
 'You lack years of education and respect,' another said, adding that he should worry about his own performance instead of insulting someone else.

But others also made harsh jokes about Gebrzihair's appearance.
One person commented: '16? That woman has lived through the American Civil War, two world wars and saw Pele's Brazil lift the 1970 World Cup.'
Another said: 'That's Benjamin Button's cousin.' 
And another added: 'Is there no other way of controlling these things apart from looking at a passport? It is hard to believe.'
Gebrzihair finished third behind her compatriot Ejgayehu Taye and Kenyan athlete Beatrice Chebet, who took gold in the 5,000m final.
MailOnline has contacted the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) and the Ethiopian Athletics Federation for comment.

The pervert father raped the infant while taking pictures on his smartphone, according to police.
He was arrested in a dramatic early morning raid at his home while his family were still sleeping, and pictures of his arrest were then released online by police.
Police have arrested a man (centre) who they allege raped his eight-month-old daughter and took pictures which he sold on Australian porn websites 
He was arrested in an early morning raid at his home while his family were still sleeping, and pictures of his arrest were then released online by police
One of the pictures shows the suspect dressed only in his underwear. Another one shows a woman and a child.
Vitaly Chubaevsky, deputy chief of the Ukrainian national cyber police department, said: 'The man was raping his child when the mother was away or was working in the garden.'
The mother only learned about what was happening with her daughter from the police and has became the most important witness in the case after she was horrified at what her husband had done, reports said.
The 27-year-old father is a former soldier, who was unable to work properly after he was injured in 2014 in Eastern Ukraine.
A police spokesperson said: 'The man's smartphone is full of evidence. We found it hidden in the baby's room among her toys.'
The mother only learned about what was happening with her daughter from the police and has became the most important witness in the case after she was horrified at what her husband had done, reports said
The pictures were circulated on Australian and Russian porn websites and were noticed by Australian cyber police, who liaised with their Ukrainian colleagues.
Ukrainian police confiscated the suspect's smartphone along with his computer, which were sent for examination. 
Online commentators have reacted with outrage.
'I thought I had seen everything, but I was wrong,' said one, while another declared that the man should 'Rot in prison.'
The suspect faces 15 years behind bars if found guilty of raping his baby daughter.
